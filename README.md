# Harry Potter Trivia Game

![trivia-game](assets/images/hp-banner.png)

### Concept
In this trivia game, players will be presented with a single Harry Potter inspired trivia question during each round.

Each question is multiple choice and the player has only 20 seconds to answer each question before the particular round ends.

Running out of time or selecting an answer will end the round, immediately displaying the correct answer and telling them if they either were correct, incorrect, or out of time.

* There is only a 4 second delay after the end of each question round  and the beginning of the next question round. 

* After all rounds are completed, players will see a final screen showing the total number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and incomplete or skipped answers and option to restart the game (without reloading the page).

### Technology Used
For this project, I used regular HTML, CSS, and Javascript as well as:
* JQuery
* Bootstrap
* An embedded font: magicschoolone

In particular, this example leverages time INTERVAL and MATH capabilities in Javascript to set automatic timers that trigger events or other functions.

## Future Development
I would like to streamline the question/answer object to make adding more quiz items easier. Also, it would be nice if the questions were displayed in a random order and then removed from the possible options to prevent any duplicates.
