* In this trivia game, players will be presented with a single Harry Potter inspired trivia question during each round.

Each question is multiple choice and the player has only 20 seconds to answer each question before the particular round ends.

Running out of time or selecting an answer will end the round, immediately displaying the correct answer and telling them if they either were correct, incorrect, or out of time.

* There is only a 4 second delay after the end of each question round  and the beginning of the next question round. 

* After all rounds are completed, players will see a final screen showing the total number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and incomplete or skipped answers and option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
